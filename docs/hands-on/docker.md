The objective of this hands-on is to familiarize you with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).


## Pulling and running an existing image

Pull a public image such as ubuntu or centos using the docker pull command.  If a tag is not specified, docker will default to "latest".

```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu:14.04
```

Now run the image using the docker run command.  Use the "-it" option to get an interactive terminal during the run.

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu:14.04
$ whoami
$ lsb_release -a
```

## Making changes and committing them

Using standard linux commands, modify the image.

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu:14.04
root@949eb1a6a099:/# (echo '#!/bin/bash'|echo "echo 'Hello World'") > /bin/hello
$ chmod 755 /bin/hello
# Test it
$ hello
# Exit
$ exit
```

Now find the container and commit the changes to a new image called hello.
```bash
docker ps -a|head -2
# Grab the Container ID
docker commit <ID> hello
```

Now try running the new image with your changes.

```bash
docker run -it hello
hello
```

## Creating and Building a `Dockerfile`

While manually modifying and commiting changes is one way to build images, using a [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) provides a way to build images so that others can understand how the image was constructed and make modifications.

A `Dockerfile` has many options.  We will focus on a few basic ones (FROM, MAINTAINER, ADD, and RUN)

Create a simple shell script called script in your local directory using your favorite editor.

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Just say Hello World!"
```

Now create a file called `Dockerfile` in the same directory with contents similar to this.  Use your own name and e-mail for the maintainer.

```
FROM ubuntu:14.04
MAINTAINER Joe Smith <joe@user.com>

ADD . /src
RUN cp /src/script /bin/hello && chmod 755 /bin/hello
```

Now build the image using the docker build command.  Be sure to use the `-t` option to tag it.  Tell the `Dockerfile` to build using the current directory by specifying `.`.  Alternatively you could place the Dockerfile and script in an alternate location and specify that directory in the docker build command.

```bash
docker build -t hello:1.0 .
```

Try running the image.

```bash
docker run -it hello:1.0
/bin/hello
```

## Pushing a Dockerfile to dockerhub

Docker provides a public hub that can be use to store and share images.  Before pushing an image, you will need to create an account at Dockerhub.  Go to [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/) to create the account.  Once the account is created, push your test image using the docker push command.  In this example, we will assume the username is patsmith.

```bash
docker tag hello:1.0 patsmith/hello:1.0
docker push patsmith/hello:1.0
```

The first push make take some time depending on your network connection and the size of the image.
